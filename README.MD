## A suggested plan of action

1) Get an ugly frontend up
    -Just the components, don't worry about the AJAX yet
2) Stub the backend endpoints
    -Send examples of the kind of data you will send
    -Don't worry about authentication yet
3) Tie the frontend and backend together
4) Work out a simple version of the algorithm using a static array of questions
    -Incorporate this into the backend stubs
5) Move to have the questions stored in a database
6) Get the authentication system in place
7) Move to having the user data stored in the database
