## A suggested plan of action:

1) Get an ugly frontend up
    -Just the components, don't worry about the AJAX yet
2) Stub the backend endpoints
    -Send examples of the kind of data you will send
    -Don't worry about authentication yet
3) Tie the frontend and backend together
4) Work out a simple version of the algorithm using a static array of questions
    -Incorporate this into the backend stubs
5) Move to have the questions stored in a database
*6) Get the authentication system in place
*7) Move to having the user data stored in the database



## Further items:

* Let the backend serve the client side view
* Let MLab run mongo db for deployment



3) Reset m-values when you restart quiz.
4) Ask about how to link to the font file
5) fix links in directory

5) Add stats after user integration.
6) Add images for question previews.
7) Add dothraki quotes on in-between quiz pages.
