## A suggested plan of action:

1) Get an ugly frontend up
    -Just the components, don't worry about the AJAX yet
2) Stub the backend endpoints
    -Send examples of the kind of data you will send
    -Don't worry about authentication yet
3) Tie the frontend and backend together
4) Work out a simple version of the algorithm using a static array of questions
    -Incorporate this into the backend stubs
5) Move to have the questions stored in a database
*6) Get the authentication system in place
*7) Move to having the user data stored in the database

## Further items:
1) Don't let m-values decrement below 1.
2) Make header text into links for homepage/levels.
3) Reset m-values when you restart quiz.
4) Clear input box after every submission.
5) Add stats after user integration.
6) Add images for question previews.
7) Add dothraki quotes on in-between quiz pages.
